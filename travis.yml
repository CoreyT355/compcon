# We go through some contortions in here and the package.json
# calls because a) we have to hardwire a build location
# into packages's build.directories.output and b) we need to match
# a number of specific folder names for itch.io's outputs.
# The last is because, at the time of automation, there was already
# a pipeline with subscribers on itch that we had to not disrupt.
# That said, I'm sure a refactor could improve all this.
